## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3
- Stylus CSS Preprocessor
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was a fun, quick little challenge that helped reinforce concepts from the full-stack web development bootcamp I participated in. In particular, I really needed a refresher on mobile-first development and the CSS flexbox. My favorite part, though, was using Stylus. It was really useful and made creating the stylesheet for this project much faster!

### Useful resources

- [Stylus Docs](https://stylus-lang.com/docs/executable.html) - I referenced the Stylus docs quite a bit for this challenge and found that it is really well written and organized.
